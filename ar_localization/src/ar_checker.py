'''
You need to fly the drone in position control mode to see the AR tags and 
publish their number when you are a (TARGET_DIS +/- TARGET_THRESH) meters away. 
Tag numbers should only be published ONCE per tag seen.

Tags must be visited in the correct order. We are not picky about how you do this:
you can either implement checking in the code so that you do not report seeing
a tag out of order, or you can be very careful how you fly the drone.
